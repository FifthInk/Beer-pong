## Description
In this game, you can place a realistically sized table on the floor and toss balls into cups until they all disappear. This involved building 3D objects both directly and with code, including physics (static vs. dynamic, force, friction, restitution etc.) and geometry (x, y, z coordinates, shapes, sizing).
